Obi-Kaya is a Smart Community Assistant Agent designed to empower community organizers/managers or anyone in DevRel, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, to maximize their community's impact, secure partnerships, and sustain engagement. The agent analyzes community data, generates actionable recommendations, crafts partnership/sponsorship pitches, and provides strategies for ongoing engagement. It is multilingual and can respond in most African languages.

- `agent.py`: Main file containing the agent definition and all tool implementations.
- `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [google-adk](https://pypi.org/project/google-adk/)
- [google-genai](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/)

## Installation

1. **Clone or Fork the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Obi-Kaya.git
   cd Obi-Kaya
   ```
   *(If you haven't already, fork the repo at https://github.com/mwanyumba7/Obi-Kaya and clone your fork)*

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment You Created Above**

For Windows: 
   ```sh
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

For Mac or Linux: 
   ```sh

## Step-by-Step Guide: Building the Agent

### 1. Project Setup
- Ensure your folder structure matches the one above.
- All code will be in `obi_kaya_agent/agent.py`.

### 2. Implementing the Tools

#### a. `generate_recommendations_from_input`
This tool analyzes community data (text or PDF content) and returns structured, actionable recommendations in three categories:
- Event Ideas & Timing
- Social Media Strategy
- Ongoing Engagement (Beyond Events)

**How it works:**
- Accepts user input (text or extracted PDF content).
- Builds a prompt for the Gemini LLM to generate recommendations.
- Returns a dictionary with recommendations organized by category.

#### b. `generate_partnership_pitch`
This tool generates a personalized partnership/sponsorship pitch using community data (text, Google Word, or PDF content). The pitch includes:
- Community Overview
- Engagement Metrics
- Impact Statements
- Value Proposition
- Next Steps

**How it works:**
- Accepts user input (text or extracted report content).
- Builds a prompt for the Gemini LLM to generate a structured pitch.
- Returns a dictionary with the pitch organized by section.

#### c. `answer_community_general_question`
This tool answers general questions about community building, being a tech community organizer, creating and measuring impact, and troubleshooting Bevy platform issues.

**How it works:**
- Accepts a question as input.
- Builds a prompt for the Gemini LLM, referencing best practices and support resources.
- Returns a dictionary with the question and a detailed answer.

### 3. Defining the Agent
The agent is defined in `agent.py` using the `Agent` class from `google.adk.agents`. It includes:
- Name, model, description, and detailed instructions.
- The three tools above registered in the `tools` list.

### 4. Running and Viewing the Agent in ADK Web UI

1. **Start the ADK Web UI**
   ```sh
   adk web
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to the URL provided (usually http://localhost:8080).
3. Select your agent (`obi_kaya_agent`) and interact with it using the web interface.

## Example Usage

- **Get recommendations:** Upload a PDF report or paste community data, and ask for event or engagement ideas.
- **Generate a partnership pitch:** Provide your community stats and request a sponsorship pitch.
- **Ask a general question:** "How do I increase engagement in my developer community?" or "How do I troubleshoot event registration on Bevy?"

## Code Explanation

All tools are implemented as Python functions in `agent.py`. Each tool:
- Accepts input (text, question, or report content).
- Builds a prompt for the Gemini LLM.
- Handles the LLM response and returns structured output.

The agent is then instantiated with these tools, a description, and clear instructions on what topics it can help with.
